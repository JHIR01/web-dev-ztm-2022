        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <p>
            I am a college drop out that wanted to get into programming right away!<br>
            My goal is to create, help create, software that can help people in their<br>
            everyday lives. With today's heavy reliance on technology, there is always<br>
            something that could be made for people's needs. And because if that, I<br>
            think that becoming a software developer will help me with assisting the<br>
            most people that I can.<br>
