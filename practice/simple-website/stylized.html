            <p>
                Sorry that this don't look as good as I would want it to be. <br>
                But, in the future I hope to make links to websites that look <br>
                a lot better than this one. For now, I'm just going to be<br>
                talking about different things<br>  
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                For now I would like to talk about my pets! Mochi and Smokey.<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <div id="mochi">
            <h2>Mochi</h2>
                <p>
                    Mochi is my white Shiba Inu. She is a champion bread and is very<br>
                    pretty. I think she knows when someone is taking a photo of her<br>
                    because she always looks cute in her pictures. I have had her for<br>
                    almost 8 years, and I have loved every bit of that time. She is<br>
                    a really shy dog and doesn't like to socialize with others of her<br>
                    kind. But, when there is another human outside of my family, she<br>
                    will seek for their attention.

            <div id="smokey">
            <h2>Smokey</h2>
                <p>
                    Smokey is my ashey-grey Russian Blue cat. He came from my brother's<br>
                    dorm back when he was in college. Him and his girlfriend, at the<br>
                    time, sporatically got him. And ever since my brother moved back, <by>
                    Smokey has been living with me and my family. He's a lot more shy<br>
                    than Mochi, and he's no the biggest fan of getting attention from<br>
                    other humans. He's a chonky cat(only do to the fact that my dad <by>
                    plays favorites with his pets), and I love him.
